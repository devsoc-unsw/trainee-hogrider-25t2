        "Unfortunately, my boss won’t be attending—their AI assistant suggested allocating their cognitive bandwidth elsewhere. Such a helpful little algorithm."
        "I'm sorry, but my boss is on a conference call. They can't make it."
        "Regretfully, they’re not able to attend. The AI system that optimizes their day flagged this as... flexible importance."
        "My boss is unavailable. Their calendar is curated by predictive AI now, and well… it predicted this meeting wouldn’t spark joy."
        "Unfortunately, they won’t attend. Apparently, their AI tool detected too much ‘circular discussion risk’ and recommended self-care instead."
